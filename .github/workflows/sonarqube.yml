# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# This workflow helps you trigger a SonarQube analysis of your code and populates
# GitHub Code Scanning alerts with the vulnerabilities found.
# (this feature is available starting from SonarQube 9.7, Developer Edition and above)

# 1. Make sure you add a valid GitHub configuration to your SonarQube (Administration > DevOps platforms > GitHub)

# 2. Import your project on SonarQube
#     * Add your repository as a new project by clicking "Create project" from your homepage.
#
# 3. Select GitHub Actions as your CI and follow the tutorial
#     * a. Generate a new token and add it to your GitHub repository's secrets using the name SONAR_TOKEN
#          (On SonarQube, click on your avatar on top-right > My account > Security or ask your administrator)
#
#     * b. Copy/paste your SonarQube host URL to your GitHub repository's secrets using the name SONAR_HOST_URL
#
#     * c. Copy/paste the project Key into the args parameter below
#          (You'll find this information in SonarQube by following the tutorial or by clicking on Project Information at the top-right of your project's homepage)

# Feel free to take a look at our documentation (https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/github-integration/)
# or reach out to our community forum if you need some help (https://community.sonarsource.com/c/sq/10)
